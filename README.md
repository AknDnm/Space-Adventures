The purpose of this game is to destroy all of the enemies without dying. Each level of the game becomes increasingly difficult and new enemy types are introduced throughout. Currently the game contains four enemy types and there are seven levels to complete. The difficulty setting of the game can also be adjusted across three levels. The adjustment of this level alters the firing rate of the enemiesâ€™ guns and the damage of enemy projectiles.

I used namespaces to both organize and better view the interdependencies of my classes. I used Unity Event System and interfaces to prevent any circular dependencies or unnecessary 'Update()' functions. Also I used Object Pooling Design Pattern for projectiles and animated effects. The game utilises a saving system store progression and player adjusted settings.
